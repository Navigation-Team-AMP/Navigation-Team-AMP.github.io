One thing this team struggled with a lot this past semester was documentation.
Truthfully, it's something that probably could have been addressed sooner, but
I realize that it's really unfair to have 3 students who have already had
a bunch of exposure to the tech stack and already dealt with a plethora of
issues just completely take over the project, then expect someone who hasn't
even had the chance to commit to be able to understand the stack.

This semester, what I'd really like to do is to make at least a paper trail of
a lot of the work we try to do as a team, so at the very least we can start to
keep track of what's going on, even if its not the 100% perfect complete picture.
This blog is one of the main ways I would like to do that, as well as through
better wiki support for the repositories (I'll try and figure that part out
later).

This post is being written right as the summer starts, and we have some plans
to try and get really involved with the actual IAC team, which is really
exciting! We have really been trying to show our stripes with what we created,
and although I personally am really proud of what we are able to [present](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcPE5ryVubE) so
far. Being able to have our code potentially reach the Indy Autonomous
[Challenge](https://www.indyautonomouschallenge.com/) would be the coolest thing, as it's the sort of thing a lot of us dream
about what we signed up for the team. 

Right now, what I would like to do is post weekly updates on our progress, as
well as what we plan to do for the next week, every week, and hopefully over
time, we will have a pretty strong trail of what we do, so that everyone can
start to see what's going on with our team.
